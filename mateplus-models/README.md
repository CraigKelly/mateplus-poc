# mateplus-models

This small project is used to build the large (600MB) model JAR file that we
use in our demo project. This is for documentation purposes - you shouldn't
need to run it since the model JAR has already been created.

# Running

You must first download all the model files into `./models` using the script
`./models/get_models.sh`

Running `./local-build` will generate and install the model JAR locally
